# QR Code Generator

This Python script generates QR codes for given URLs using the `qrcode` library. It also includes functionality to decode the QR code using the `pyzbar` library.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Install the required libraries by running:
   ```
   pip install qrcode
   pip install pyzbar
   pip install pillow
   ```

   Alternatively, you can install them all at once by running:
   ```
   pip install qrcode pyzbar pillow
   ```

## Usage

1. Modify the script to include the URLs you want to generate QR codes for.

2. Run the script:
   ```
   python qr_code_generator.py
   ```

3. The generated QR codes will be saved as `myqr.png` and `myqr1.png`.

4. The script also decodes the QR code from `myqr.png` and prints the decoded URL.

## Installation Requirements

Before running the script, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- **qrcode**: This library is used to generate QR codes.
- **pyzbar**: Used for decoding QR codes.
- **pillow**: Required for image processing tasks.

You can install these libraries using pip:

```
pip install qrcode
pip install pyzbar
pip install pillow
```

Once the libraries are installed, you can proceed with running the script as described in the Usage section above.
